\section{Introduction}
In todays world of globalisation and digitalisation, to keep up with the rapidly growing economy, one important challenge is the automisation of tasks. One aspect of this is the classification of visual inputs. Whether it is to check for broken parts in production or surveillance of public places. With the rapidly growing power of computers, neural networks are becoming more popular for these kind of tasks as they need a lot of computational power but deliver sufficient accurate results.\\
In the following project we want to build a framework with a intuitive graphical user interface to achieve these kind of tasks.\\
To speed up the process of classification the software will be able to use different hardware that is more efficient for these kind of calculations. To further adjust the neural network to its task it should have different modes to function on, high performance, low power consumption and a high energy effiency mode. \\


\section{Goal}
The goal of this project is to create a software which performs sufficient accurate image classification and is able to switch between deployment platforms and working modes. The software will be able to predict the power consumption and the preformance (bandwidth, FLOPs).\\
The software should also have a GUI to interact with the program and to visualise the results.\\
The software should be extendable for further tasks.


\section{Product use}
The target group is engineers with a basic knowdlege of data science.\\
The software is used to classify images on different deployment platforms with different working modes using a pretrained neural network.\\
Additionally, the software can be extended to be used for image detection, classification of frames from a videostream and training of a \gls{nn}.\\

\section{System models}
\subsection{Scenarios}
\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
The user U1 wants to classify the image of a cat. He goes on the classifcation page and he clicks on the dropdown and sees the three modes \glqq low power consumption\grqq , \glqq high perfomance\grqq and \glqq high energy effiency\grqq , he can also see the predicted power consumption and performance. He chooses to classificate in the low power mode and runs the programm. The results are shown.
\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
The user U2 goes to the classification page and chooses the image of coala and the high power performance mode and CPU mode. The software states that it would take 86 watts with 166 GFLOPs. U2 decides he would rather use the high energy effiency mode with 140 GFLOPs and 70 watts. He sets the other parameters and clicks on Start image classification. The result is that the image is a coala and shows this result. 
\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
The user U3 created the blueprint for a new nn.
He wants to train a network based on this config file but computation time is shared and expensive. Therefore U3 has to convince his boss.
U3 uses the software as input and selects the visualization toolkit.
U3 saves the output and uses it during the discussion to demonstrate the advantages of his new neural network.
\clearpage
\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
User U4 has to categorize a large dataset of plants from a biology field trip. U4 has two trained neural networks for this task. The first with a good accuracy and high confidence on leaves. The second with a high confidence and accuracy on flowers. On unknown objects they both tend to have a low confidence. U4 does not want to manually decide which network to use for every image . He also does not want to train a new neural network. Therefore U4 selects both networks and the folder with the new images inside, as well as the parameters save-result and dont-show results. The software classifies all images in a few minutes and he is able to handover the dataset for further documentation.
\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
User U5 has heared about this software and wants to test it.
U5 is a pokemon fan, therefore he decides to use a new neural network to classify the newest generation pokemon. None of the provided networks was trained for that task, so U5 decides to train a new neural network. U5 copies an existing neural network layout file and adds a 5 fully connected layers in between, to create a larget neural network. U5 uses his large pokemon image dataset, his new neural network layout file and the software, to train a new neural network. 
Afterwards U5 creates a folder with new pokemon images and uses his new network and the software to classify them.
\subsubsection{Scenario 7}
Alex had a trip in Africa and made a lot of pictures of animals. He looks for an easy way to know how many different species of animals he saw and took photos of. Alex doesn't know how to code or to run a program thus he needs a friendly and understandable Graphical User Interface, that our software offers. Alex opens the main menu of the software where he sees that it's possible to finish his task, without any knowledge, because of the GUI. 
\subsubsection{Scenario 8}
The company GoZoo wants to develop an AI to feed the animals at Zoos. The Firm doesn't have enough labelers to label all of the frames they need to teach the software which animal it is seeing at the moment. GoZoo decides to use Tucs's object detection.An employee goes on the Detection page of the software and uses it to label the frames required for the AI.
\clearpage
\subsubsection{Scenario 9}
The company EducationFirst wants to teach small kids parallel to read, recognize percents and animals. Tucs is just right for the job, because of the Image Classification option of the software. The CEO of EducationFirst hears about Tucs and now wants to test it. He assigns a few employees with their kids to try the software. The results are outstanding! Because of the intuitive layout and the structure of the Image Classification page of Tucs, the kids are able to learn and also having fun at the same time.
