\textbf{FR080} & \textbf{Choosing platform/hardware}\\
& Testet with: Implements: \\
& The GUI has a dropdown which lists the devices on which the classification can be done. The devices which can be theoretically be accessed but aren't connected to the host pc or the communication with them doesn't work are grayed out. \\
\textbf{FR090} & \textbf{Choosing mode}\\
& Testet with: Implements: \\
& The GUI has dropdown which lists the modes (high performance mode, low power consumption mode and best energy effiency mode). The power consumption in Watts and performance in FLOPs are also stated behind the mode names.
