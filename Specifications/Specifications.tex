\section{Introduction}
In todays world of globalisation and digitalisation, to keep up with the rapidly growing economy, one important challenge is the automatisation of tasks. One aspect of this is the classification of visual inputs. Whether it is to check for broken parts in production or surveillance of public places. With the rapidly growing power of computers, \glspl{nn} are becoming more popular for tasks like this, as they need a lot of computational power but deliver sufficiently accurate results.\\
In the following project we want to build a framework with an intuitive graphical user interface to achieve these kinds of tasks.\\
To speed up the process of classification the software will be able to use different hardware that is more efficient for specific calculations. To further adjust the \gls{nn} to its task it should have different \glspl{om} to function on. High \gls{performance}, low \gls{power consumption} and a high energy effiency mode.


\section{Goal}
The goal of this project is to create a software which performs sufficiently accurate \gls{image classification} and is able to switch between \glspl{dp} and \glspl{om}. The software will be able to predict the \gls{power consumption} and the \gls{performance} (\gls{bw}, \gls{flops}).\\
The software should also have a GUI to interact with the program and to visualise the results.\\
The software should be extendable for further tasks.


\section{Product use}
The target group are engineers with a basic knowledge of data science.\\
The software is used to classify images on different \glspl{dp} with different \glspl{om} using a pretrained \gls{nn}.\\
Additionally, the software can be extended to be used for image detection, classification of frames from a videostream and training of a \gls{nn}.

\section{System models}
\subsection{Scenarios}
\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
The user U1 wants to classify the image of a cat. He goes on the classifcation page and he clicks on the dropdown and sees the three \glspl{om} \glqq low \gls{power consumption}\grqq , \glqq high perfomance\grqq and \glqq high energy effiency\grqq . He can also see the predicted \gls{power consumption} and \gls{performance}. He chooses to classificate in the low power mode and runs the programm. The results are shown.
\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
The user U2 goes to the classification page and chooses the image of a coala and the high power \gls{performance} mode and CPU mode. The software states that it would take 86 watts with 166 G\gls{flops}. U2 decides he would rather use the high energy effiency mode with 140 G\gls{flops} and 70 watts. He sets the other parameters and clicks on Start \gls{image classification}. The result is that the image is a coala and shows this result. 
\subsubsection{Scenario 3}
The user U3 created the blueprint for a new \gls{nn} in .cfg.\\
She wants to train a network based on this config file but computation time is shared and expensive. Therefore U3 has to convince her boss.
U3 uses the software with her \gls{nn} as input and selects the visualisation toolkit.\\
U3 saves the output and uses it during the discussion to demonstrate the advantages of her new \gls{nn}.
\clearpage
\subsubsection{Scenario 4}
User U4 has to categorise a large dataset of plants from a biology field trip. U4 has two trained \glspl{nn} for this task. The first with a good accuracy and high confidence on leaves. The second with a high confidence and accuracy on flowers. On unknown objects they both tend to have a low confidence. U4 does not want to manually decide which network to use for every image. He also does not want to train a new \gls{nn}. Therefore U4 selects both networks and the folder with the new images inside, as well as the parameters save-result and dont-show results. The software classifies all images in a few minutes and he is able to handover the dataset for further documentation.
\subsubsection{Scenario 5}
User U5 has heared about this software and wants to test it.
U5 is a pokemon fan, therefore he decides to use a new \gls{nn} to classify the newest generation pokemon. None of the provided networks was trained for that task, so U5 decides to train a new \gls{nn}. U5 copies an existing \gls{nn} layout file and adds five (5) fully connected layers in between to create a larget \gls{nn}. U5 uses his large pokemon image dataset, his new \gls{nn} layout file and the software, to train a new \gls{nn}. 
Afterwards U5 creates a folder with new pokemon images and uses his new network and the software to classify them.
\subsubsection{Scenario 6}
U6 had a trip in Africa and made a lot of pictures of animals. He looks for an easy way to know how many different species of animals he saw and took photos of. Alex doesn't know how to code or to run a program thus he needs a friendly and understandable Graphical User Interface, that our software offers. Alex opens the main menu of the software where he sees that it's possible to finish his task, without any knowledge, because of the GUI. 
\clearpage
\subsubsection{Scenario 7}
U7, a company, wants to develop an AI to feed the animals at Zoos. The company does not have enough labelers to label all of the frames they need to teach the software which animal it is seeing at the moment. U7 decides to use the software for object detection. An employee goes on the Detection page of the software and uses it to label the frames required for the AI.
\subsubsection{Scenario 8}
The company U8 wants to teach small kids parallel to read, recognize percents and animals. The software is just right for the job, because of the \gls{image classification} option of the software. The CEO of U8 hears about Tucs and now wants to test it. He assigns a few employees with their kids to try the software. The results are outstanding! Because of the intuitive layout and the structure of the \gls{image classification} page of the software, the kids are able to learn and also having fun at the same time.
